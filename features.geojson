Australia CarbonNet Project Nominators: Australia (lead) and United States  This is a large-scale project that will implement a large-scale multi-user CO2 capture, transport, and storage network in southeastern Australia in the Latrobe Valley. Multiple industrial and utility point sources of CO2 will be connected via a pipeline to a site where the CO2 can be stored in saline aquifers in the Gippsland Basin. The project initially plans to sequester approximately 1 to 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year, with the potential to increase capacity significantly over time. The project will also include reservoir characterization and, once storage is underway, measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) technologies.  Recognized by the CSLF at its Perth meeting, October 2012  Links to More Information  Presentation at 2012 CSLF Annual Meeting (October 2012) State Government of Victoria Brochure about the project CO2CRC Otway Project Nominators: Australia (lead) and United States  Recognized by the CSLF at its Paris meeting in March 2007, this is a pilot-scale project that involves transport and injection of approximately 100,000 tons of CO2 into a depleted natural gas well over a two year period. Besides the operational aspects of processing, transport and injection of a CO2-containing gas stream, the project also includes development and testing of new and enhanced monitoring, and verification of storage (MMV) technologies, modeling of post-injection CO2 behavior, and implementation of an outreach program for stakeholders and nearby communities.  Data from the project will be used in developing a future regulatory regime for CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in Australia.  Links to More Information  CO2CRC Project Website Project Presentation (pdf 1.47 MB) Poster from Paris workshop (March 2007) (pdf 1.08 MB) Project Details (from IEA Web site) CO2CRC Otway Project, Stage 2 Nominators: Australia (lead) and United States  This is the 2nd stage of a multi-stage CO2 storage program, located in southwestern Victoria, Australia.  The goal is to increase the knowledge base for CO2 storage in geologic deep saline formations through seismic visualization of injected CO2 migration and stabilization.  Stage 2 of the overall project will extend into the year 2020 and will include sequestration of approx. 15,000 tonnes of CO2.  The injected plume will be observed from injection through to stabilization, to assist in the calibrating and validation of reservoir modeling’s predictive capability.  An anticipated outcome from the project will be improvement on methodologies for the characterization, injection and monitoring of CO2 storage in deep saline formations.

The goal is to increase the knowledge base for CO2 storage in geologic deep saline formations through seismic visualization of injected CO2 migration and stabilization.  Stage 2 of the overall project will extend into the year 2020 and will include sequestration of approx. 15,000 tonnes of CO2.  The injected plume will be observed from injection through to stabilization, to assist in the calibrating and validation of reservoir modeling’s predictive capability.  An anticipated outcome from the project will be improvement on methodologies for the characterization, injection and monitoring of CO2 storage in deep saline formations.  Project presentation CO2CRC Project website Gorgon CO2 Injection Project Nominators: Australia (lead), Canada, and United States  This is a large-scale project that will store approximately 120 million tonnes of CO2 in a water-bearing sandstone formation two kilometers below Barrow Island, off the northwest coast of Australia. The CO2 stored by the project will be extracted from natural gas being produced from the nearby Gorgon Field and injected at approximately 3.5 to 4 million tonnes per year. There is an extensive integrated monitoring plan, and the objective of the project is to demonstrate the safe commercial-scale application of greenhouse gas storage technologies at a scale not previously attempted.

The project evaluated reservoir properties of selected coal seams of the Qinshui Basin of eastern China and carried out field testing at relatively low CO2 injection rates. The project recommendation was to proceed to full scale pilot test at south Qinshui, as the prospect in other coal basins in China is good.

The goals were to compile key characteristics of large anthropogenic CO2 sources (including power generation, iron and steel plants, cement kilns, petroleum and chemical refineries, etc.) as well as candidate geologic storage formations, and to develop estimates of geologic CO2 storage capacities in China. The project found 2,300 gigatons of potential CO2 storage capacity in onshore Chinese basins, significantly more than previous estimates. Another important finding is that the heavily developed coastal areas of the East and South Central regions appear to have less access to large quantities of onshore storage capacity than many of the inland regions. These findings present the possibility for China’s continued economic growth with coal while safely and securely reducing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
